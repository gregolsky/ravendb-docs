# Choosing Time Series Range

---

{NOTE: }

* Queries can retrieve data from the entire time series or from a specific range of entries,  
  such as those collected in the last 7 days.

* In this page:
    * [Choose range in a query](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/choosing-query-range#choose-range-in-a-query)
      * [Specify range](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/choosing-query-range#specify-range)
      * [Retrieve first or last entries](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/choosing-query-range#retrieve-first-or-last-entries)
    * [Choose range - RQL syntax](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/choosing-query-range#choose-range---rql-syntax)
      * [`between` and `and`](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/choosing-query-range#and-)
      * [`first` and `last`](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/querying/choosing-query-range#and--1)

{PANEL: Choose range in a query}

#### Specify range:

* Provide 'from' & 'to' DateTime values to the time series query to retrieve entries only from that range (inclusive).  
  Omitting these parameters will retrieve the entire series.  

* The provided DateTime values are handled by the server as UTC.  
  The client does Not perform any conversion to UTC prior to sending the request to the server.  

* In this example, we specify a 10-minute range from which we retrieve UK employees "HeartRates" entries.  

{CODE-BLOCK:sql}
from "Employees" as employee
where employee.Address.Country == "UK"
select timeseries(
    from employee.HeartRates
    between "2020-05-17T00:00:00.0000000"
    and "2020-05-17T00:10:00.0000000"
    offset "03:00"
)
{CODE-BLOCK/}

---

#### Retrieve first or last entries:

* Use `first` to specify the time frame from the start of the time series.  
  Use `last` to specify the time frame from the end of the time series.  
  A query function can use either `first` or `last`, but not both.  

* In this example, we select only entries in the last 30 minutes of the "HeartRates" time series.

{CODE-BLOCK:sql}
from "Employees" as e 
select timeseries(
    from e.HeartRates
    last 30 min
    offset "03:00"
)
{CODE-BLOCK/}

{PANEL: Choose range - RQL syntax}

#### `between` and `and`:

* Use the `between` and `and` keywords to retrieve time series entries from the specified range (inclusive).  
  Provide the timestamps in UTC format.
  E.g.:  
  {CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL_select_syntax}
from "Employees"
where Address.Country == "UK"
select timeseries(
    from HeartRates
    between "2020-05-17T00:00:00.0000000Z" // start of range
    and "2020-05-17T01:00:00.0000000Z"     // end of range
)

// Results will include only time series entries within the specified range for employees from UK.
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL_declare_syntax}
declare timeseries getHeartRates(employee)
{
    from HeartRates
    between "2020-05-17T00:00:00.0000000Z" // start of range
    and "2020-05-17T01:00:00.0000000Z"     // end of range
}

from "Employees" as e
where e.Address.Country == "UK"
select getHeartRates(e) 

// Results will include only time series entries within the specified range for employees from UK.
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

* RQL queries can be executed from Studio's [query view](../../../studio/database/queries/query-view).  
  Using Studio, you can apply parameters as follows for a clearer query.  
  {CODE-BLOCK:sql}
$from = "2020-05-17T00:00:00.0000000Z"
$to = "2020-05-17T01:00:00.0000000Z"

from "Employees"
where Address.Country == "UK"
select timeseries(
    from HeartRates
    between $from and $to  // using parameters
)
{CODE-BLOCK/}

---

#### `first` and `last`:

* Use `first` to specify the time frame from the start of the time series.  
  Use `last` to specify the time frame from the end of the time series.  
  A query function can use either `first` or `last`, but not both. E.g. -  

     {CODE-BLOCK: sql}
// Retrieve all entries from the last day, starting from the end of time series "HeartRates"
from "Employees"
select timeseries(
    from HeartRates
    last 1 day
)
{CODE-BLOCK/}

     {CODE-BLOCK: sql}
// Retrieve the first 10 minutes of entries from the beginning of time series "HeartRates"
from "Employees"
select timeseries(
    from HeartRates
    first 10 min
)
{CODE-BLOCK/}

* The range is specified using a whole number of one of the following units.  

    * **seconds**  ( seconds/ second / s )
    * **minutes**  ( minutes / minute / min )
    * **hours**    ( hours / hour / h )
    * **days**     ( days / day / d )
    * **months**   ( months / month / mon / mo )
    * **quarters** ( quarters / quarter / q )
    * **years**    ( years / year / y )
    * Note: **milliseconds** are currently not supported by 'first' and 'last' in a time series query.
