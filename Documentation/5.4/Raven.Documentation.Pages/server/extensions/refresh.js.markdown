# Document Refresh
---

{NOTE: }

* The Refresh feature increments a document's [change vector](../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector), 
  triggering its re-indexation as well as other features that react to document updates.  

* Refresh is scheduled using the `@refresh` flag in a document's [metadata](../../client-api/session/how-to/get-and-modify-entity-metadata).  

* In this page:  
  * [Overview](../../server/extensions/refresh#overview)  
  * [Examples](../../server/extensions/refresh#examples)
  * [Syntax](../../server/extensions/refresh#syntax)
  * [Configure from Studio](../../server/extensions/refresh#configure-from-studio)

{PANEL: Overview}

To refresh a document, add a `@refresh` flag to the document's metadata specifying datetime in UTC format.  
This indicates when the document should be refreshed.  

This will cause the document to refresh **_only once_**! The refresh operation removes 
the `@refresh` flag.  

The exact time that the document refreshes is not determined by the value of `@refresh` 
- rather, the server refreshes documents at regular intervals determined by the Refresh 
Configuration. The default interval is 60 seconds.  

Refreshing a document causes its [change vector](../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector) 
to increment the same way it would after any other kind of update to the document. 
This triggers any features that react to documents updating, including but not limited 
to:  

* The document is re-indexed by any indexes that cover it.  
* [Replication](../../server/ongoing-tasks/external-replication), 
  [Subscriptions](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions), 
  and [ETL](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/basics) are triggered.
* A [revision](../../document-extensions/revisions/overview) of the document is created.

#### Setting the refresh configuration for a database:

To activate and/or configure document refreshing, the server needs to be sent a configuration object using the `ConfigureRefreshOperation` operation.  

{CODE:nodejs configure_refresh@server/extensions/documentRefresh.js /}

#### Set a document to refresh 1 hour from now:

{CODE:nodejs refresh_example@server/extensions/documentRefresh.js /}
