# Delete by Query Operation
---

{NOTE: }

* Use `DeleteByQueryOperation` to delete a large number of documents that match the provided query in a single server call.

* **Dynamic behavior**:   
  The deletion of documents matching the specified query is performed in batches of size 1024.  
  During the deletion process, documents that are added/modified **after** the delete operation has started  
  may also be deleted if they match the query criteria.

* **Background operation**:  
  This operation is performed in the background on the server.  
  If needed, you can **wait** for the operation to complete. See: [Wait for completion](../../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations#wait-for-completion).
