# Full-Text Search with Index
---

{NOTE: }

* Prior to this article, please refer to [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search) to learn about the `Search` method.  

* **All capabilities** provided by `Search` with a dynamic query can also be used when querying a static-index.

* However, as opposed to making a dynamic search query where an auto-index is created for you,  
  when using a **static-index**:  

    * You must configure the index-field in which you want to search.  
      See examples below.  
      
    * You can configure which analyzer will be used to tokenize this field.  
      See [selecting an analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#selecting-an-analyzer-for-a-field).

#### Query with Search:

* Use `Search` to make a full-text search when querying the index.  

* Refer to [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search) for all available **Search options**,  
  such as using wildcards, searching for multiple terms, etc.

{PANEL: Indexing all fields for FTS (using AsJson)}

* To search across ALL fields in a document without defining each one explicitly,
  use the `AsJson` method in the _Map_ function to extract all property values and index them in a single searchable field.

* This approach makes the index robust to changes in the document schema.  
  By calling `.Select(x => x.Value)` on the result of `AsJson(...)`, 
  the index automatically includes values from ALL existing and newly added properties 
  and there is no need to update the index when the document structure changes.

* {INFO: }
  This indexing method is supported only when using **Lucene** as the indexing engine.

{PANEL: Boosting search results}

* In order to prioritize results, you can provide a boost value to the searched terms.  
  This can be applied by either of the following:

  * Add a boost value to the relevant index-field **inside the index definition**.  
    Refer to article [indexes - boosting](../../indexes/boosting).

  * Add a boost value to the queried terms **at query time**.  
    Refer to article [Boost search results](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results).

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Searching with wildcards}

* When making a full-text search with wildcards in the search terms, 
  the presence of wildcards (`*`) in the terms sent to the search engine is determined by the transformations applied by the
  [analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers) used in the index.

* Note the different behavior in the following cases, as described below:  
  * [When using RavenStandardAnalyzer or StandardAnalyzer or NGramAnalyzer](../../indexes/querying/searching#when-usingoror)
  * [When using a custom analyzer](../../indexes/querying/searching#when-using-a-custom-analyzer)
  * [When using the Exact analyzer](../../indexes/querying/searching#when-using-the-exact-analyzer)

* When using [Corax](../../indexes/search-engine/corax) as the search engine,  
  this behavior will only apply to indexes that are newly created or have been reset.

{NOTE: }

##### When using&nbsp;`RavenStandardAnalyzer`&nbsp;or`StandardAnalyzer`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`NGramAnalyzer`:
---

Usually, the same analyzer used to tokenize field content at **indexing time** is also used to process the terms provided in the **full-text search query**
before they are sent to the search engine to retrieve matching documents.

**However, in the following cases**:

* When making a [dynamic search query](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search)
* or when querying a static index that uses the default [RavenStandardAnalyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#using-the-default-search-analyzer)
* or when querying a static index that uses the [StandardAnalyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#analyzers-that-remove-common-stop-words)
* or when querying a static index that uses the [NGramAnalyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#analyzers-that-tokenize-according-to-the-defined-number-of-characters)

the queried terms in the _Search_ method are processed with the [LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#using-the-default-analyzer)  
before being sent to the search engine.

This analyzer does Not remove the `*`, so the terms are sent with `*`, as provided in the search terms.  
For example:  

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Index index_3@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query search_7@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query_async search_8@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:DocumentQuery search_9@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index "Employees/ByNotes/usingDefaultAnalyzer"
where search(EmployeeNotes, "*rench")
include explanations()
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

{NOTE/}
{NOTE: }

##### When using a custom analyzer:
---

* When setting a [custom analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#creating-custom-analyzers) in your index to tokenize field content,
  then when querying the index, the search terms in the query will be processed according to the **custom analyzer's logic**.

* The `*` will remain in the terms if the custom analyzer allows it.
  It is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure that wildcards are not removed by the custom analyzer if they should be included in the query.

* Note:  
  An exception to the above is when the wildcard is used as a suffix in the search term (e.g. `Fren*`).  
  In this case the wildcard will be included in the query regardless of the analyzer's logic.

For example:  

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Index index_4@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Custom_analyzer analyzer_1@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query search_10@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query_async search_11@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:DocumentQuery search_12@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index "Employees/ByNotes/UsingCustomAnalyzer"
where search(EmployeeNotes, "*French*")
include explanations()
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

{NOTE/}
{NOTE: }

##### When using the Exact analyzer:
---

When using the default Exact analyzer in your index (which is [KeywordAnalyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#using-the-default-exact-analyzer)),  
then when querying the index, the wildcards in your search terms remain untouched.  
The terms are sent to the search engine exactly as produced by the analyzer.

For example:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Index index_5@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query search_13@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query_async search_14@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:DocumentQuery search_15@Indexes\Querying\Searching.cs /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index "Employees/ByFirstName/usingExactAnalyzer"
where search(FirstName, "Mich*")
include explanations()
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}
