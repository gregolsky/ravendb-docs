# Indexing Metadata
---

{NOTE: }

* Each document in the database includes a metadata section, stored in a special JSON object under the `@metadata` property.

* This metadata is not part of the document's content but holds internal system information (used by RavenDB),
  such as the document ID, collection name, change vector, last modified timestamp, and more,  
  as well as optional user-defined entries.

* To learn how to access (get and modify) the metadata from your client code,  
  see [How to get and modify the metadata](../client-api/session/how-to/get-and-modify-entity-metadata).

* Content from metadata properties can be extracted and **indexed** within a static index, alongside content from the document fields.
  This allows you to query for documents based on values stored in the metadata.  
  See the examples below.

{PANEL: Indexing metadata properties}

* Use the `getMetadata` method to access a documentâ€™s metadata, as shown in the example below.

* The following index definition indexes content from the `@last-modified` and `@counters` metadata properties.

{CODE:nodejs index_1@indexes/metadata.js /}

* Query for documents based on metadata values:  
  Retrieve documents that have counters and order them by their last modified timestamp.

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:nodejs:Query query_1@indexes/metadata.js /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index "Products/ByMetadata"
where HasCounters == true
order by LastModified desc
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

{PANEL: Metadata properties that can be indexed}

* The following are the **predefined metadata properties that can be indexed**:
    * `@archive-at`
    * `@attachments`
    * `@change-vector`
    * `@collection`
    * `@counters`
    * `@etag`
    * `@expires`
    * `@id`
    * `@last-modified`
    * `@refresh`
    * `@timeseries`
    * `Raven-Clr-Type`

* You can add custom metadata properties to any document as needed.  
  These custom properties can be indexed just like the predefined ones.

{WARNING: }

Note:

* The `@attachments` metadata property can only be indexed using a **Lucene** index.
* The **Corax** search engine does not support indexing complex JSON properties.  
  Learn more in [Corax: Handling complex JSON objects](../indexes/search-engine/corax#handling-of-complex-json-objects).
