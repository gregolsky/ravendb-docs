# Admin Logs
---

{NOTE: }

* The Admin Logs view in the Studio provides two main functionalities:  
  * **Live log stream** 
      * Displays a continuous stream of RavenDB log entries in real time.
      * Log entries can be displayed in a raw format or expanded into a structured view.
      * Entries can be exported to a file for further analysis.
  * **Logs on disk settings** 
      * Define settings that determine which log entries are written to disk. 
      * Stored log files from remote servers can be downloaded by date range.
  
* **Powerful filters** can be applied both to the live log stream and to the stored log files,  
  allowing you to refine the displayed or logged entries based on criteria such as the entry content,  
  originating resource, logger, or any other criteria.

![Admin Logs view](images/admin-logs_admin-logs-view.png "Admin Logs view")

1. [Logs on this view](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#logs-on-this-view)  
   Use this section to adjust how the live log stream is displayed.  
   You can filter the streamed data and export it in JSON format.  
2. [Logs on disk](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#logs-on-disk)  
   Use this section to customize RavenDB's logging to your local storage.  
   Filters can be applied here too, and you can download selected portions of your logs.  
3. [Log stream](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#log-stream)  
   This section shows the live stream of RavenDB's logs as they are generated.  
   You can search within the stream and expand individual log entries for more detail.

{PANEL: Logs on this view}

**Use these controls to**:  

* Adjust [monitor controls](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#monitor-controls).  
* Set the [minimum logging level](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#set-displayed-logs-minimum-level) 
  from which log entries are displayed.  
* Create [additional filters](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#set-displayed-logs-filters) 
  to select the precise data that you want to view.  
* [Export the displayed log data](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#export-displayed-logs-data) 
  to files.  

![Logs on this view](images/admin-logs_logs-on-this-view.png "Logs on this view")

1. **Active filters**  
   A lit funnel symbol indicates that filters were created and are now active.  
   See **Settings** below to learn what filters do and how to create and remove them.  
2. <a id="set-displayed-logs-minimum-level" />**Min level**  
   The minimum [logging level](../../../server/troubleshooting/logging#logging-levels) from which log entries are displayed on this view.  
   For example, selecting `Warn` (warning) will display log entries from this level and up,  
   including `Warn`, `Error`, and `Fatal`.  
3. <a id="monitor-controls" />**Monitor controls**  
    * **Pause** - Pause log entries from streaming to the display.
    * **Clear** - Clear the displayed log entries.
    * **Monitor (tail -f)** - When enabled, the display automatically scrolls to the latest log entry as new ones appear.  
      Clicking an entry and expanding its details automatically disables this option.  
4. <a id="export-displayed-logs-data" />**Export**  
   Export all log entries in expanded form to a JSON file.
5. **Settings**  
   Click to create and apply filters that control which new log entries will be displayed.  
   Only entries that match both the selected min level (see no. 2 above) and the filter's conditions will be displayed. Existing entries remain unaffected.

      ![Logs on this view - Settings](images/admin-logs_logs-on-this-view_settings.png "Logs on this view - Settings")
      
      * **A.** **Default Filter Action**  
        Once at least one filter has been defined, a **default filter** can also be created.  
        The default filter determines how log entries are handled when they either **match no filter**,  
        or when all the filters they match apply a **Neutral** action.
      * <a id="set-displayed-logs-filters" />**B.** **Filters**  
        Use this section to define new filters and manage existing ones.  
        Only entries that match all filter criteria will be displayed.  
         * **Minimum level** - The filter condition will apply to log entries with this level and above.
         * **Maximum level** - The filter condition will apply to log entries up to this level.
         * **Action** - How to handle entries that match the filter rule.

    * **A.** **Select start date**  
      Select a date for the start of the period for which you want to download RavenDB logs.  
      Alternatively, toggle **Use minimum start date** ON to load logs starting from the earliest log stored on your disk.  
    * **B.** **Select end date**  
      Select a date for the end of the period for which you want to download RavenDB logs.

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Log stream}

* This area displays live log entries as they are generated by the server, filtered by the [Logs on this view](../../../studio/server/debug/admin-logs#logs-on-this-view) settings.
  You can search and expand individual entries for more details.

     ![Log stream](images/admin-logs_log-stream.png "Log stream")

  1. **Search**  
     Only log entries containing the text you enter here will be displayed.  
     Leave empty to display all entries.  
  2. **Expand all**/**Collapse all**  
     Toggle to expand or collapse a structured, easy to read layout of all log entries content.  
  3. **Display settings**  
     Set the maximum number of log entries displayed in this view.  
        ![Display settings](images/admin-logs_display-settings.png "Display settings")  
  4. **Log entry**  
        * Each log entry follows this pipe-separated (|) pattern:  
          `<Timestamp>|<Level>|<ThreadId>|<Resource>|<Component>|<Logger>|<Message>|<Data>`  
          All fields are always present (empty if not applicable).   
            * **Timestamp** - UTC timestamp of the event.
            * **Level** - The entry's [logging level](../../../server/troubleshooting/logging#logging-levels).
            * **ThreadId** - ID of the thread that generated the log entry.
            * **Resource** - Affected resource, e.g., the server or the database name.
            * **Component** - The subsystem where the entry was generated, e.g., an index name.
            * **Logger** - The full class name of the originating [logger](../../../server/troubleshooting/logging#your-own-loggers).
            * **Message** - Event description + exception details (if any).
            * **Data** - Additional JSON context.

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:  Syntax for filter conditions}

* The structure of each log entry is defined **internally** by the following default layout string:
  `"${longdate:universalTime=true}|${level:uppercase=true}|${threadid}|${event-properties:item=Resource}|${event-properties:item=Component}|${logger}|${message:withexception=true}|${event-properties:item=Data}"`

* You can apply filter conditions to one or more of these fields to determine whether a log entry should be included or excluded from the logs.

* Conditions can be simple or complex. For example:
  * `contains('${event-properties:item=Resource}', 'DB1') and exception != null`  
    Matches entries where the _Resource_ contains _DB1_ and an exception is present.  
  * `length(message) > 200`  
    Matches entries where the length of the message exceeds 200 characters.  
  * `contains('${event-properties:item=Component}', 'MyIndex')`  
    Matches entries associated with index _MyIndex_.  
  * `logger == 'Voron.Impl.Journal.WriteAheadJournal'`  
    Matches entries from a specific logger.
