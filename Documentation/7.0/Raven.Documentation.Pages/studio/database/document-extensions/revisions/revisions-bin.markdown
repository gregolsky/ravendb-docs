* The **Revisions Bin** stores revisions of deleted documents, ensuring they remain accessible.  
  From this view, you can access these revisions or permanently delete them if needed.

{PANEL: Overview}

**What is the Revisions Bin**:

* In RavenDB, revisions can be created automatically or manually, as explained in this [overview](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview).

* Regardless of how revisions are created or whether [revisions configuration](../../../../studio/database/settings/document-revisions#revisions-configuration) is enabled,
  deleting a document that **has** revisions will always create a `"Delete Revision"`.
  If you delete a document that does Not have revisions, a "Delete Revision" will be created only if the revisions configuration is set and enabled.

* This "Delete Revision" marks the document's deletion and is stored in the **Revisions Bin**.  
  In addition, all the revisions that were created over time for the deleted document are also moved to the Revisions Bin.
  Moving the revisions to the Revisions Bin ensures that historical data remains accessible.

**Deleting revisions**:

* To clear up space, you can **manually** delete revisions from the Revisions Bin.  
  Removing a selected "Delete Revision" will also delete ALL its associated revisions.  
  This action is irreversible - once a revision is removed from the bin, it cannot be recovered.  

* To clean the Revisions Bin **automatically**, you can set up the [Revisions Bin Cleaner](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/revisions-bin-cleaner),  
  which deletes revisions based on a defined frequency and a specified "age to keep".

* While the Revisions Bin provides access only to a deleted document's revisions,  
  the [All Revisions](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/all-revisions) view provides access to ALL revisions in the database,
  where they can also be deleted.

* For a complete list of deletion options, see [All ways to delete revisions](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/all-revisions#all-ways-to-delete-revisions).

---

**Restoring revisions**:

* Revisions of a deleted document can be restored from the Revisions Bin and associated with a new document.
  Learn more [below](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions-bin#restoring-revisions).

  To restore them, create a new document with the **exact same ID** as the deleted document.  

* When a new document is created with the same ID:  
  * The revisions of the deleted document are retrieved from the Revisions Bin and associated with the new document.
  * These revisions are removed from the Revisions Bin once restored.
  * The "Delete Revision" that marked the original document's deletion will also be removed from the Revisions Bin  
    and will now appear in the new documentâ€™s revision history.
