# Viewing Document Revisions
---

{NOTE: }

* **Document Revisions** are snapshots of documents that can be created manually or automatically when a document is created, modified, or deleted.
  Revisions can be used for data auditing, instant restoration after document corruption, and other purposes.

* Learn more about document revisions in this [document revisions overview](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview):  
  * To define and enable revisions creation, see [revisions configuration](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview#revisions-configuration).  
  * A dynamic walkthrough demonstrating revisions management is available [here](../../../../document-extensions/revisions/overview#how-it-works).  

* This article provides an overview of how to view and compare revisions of a specific document.  
  * To see all revisions in the database, go to the [All Revisions](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/all-revisions) view.  
  * To access revisions of deleted documents, go to the [Revisions Bin](../../../../studio/database/document-extensions/revisions/revisions-bin) view.

  and compare revisions to the live document version and to other revisions.
