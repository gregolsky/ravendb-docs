# AI Connection Strings - Overview
---

{NOTE: }

* In RavenDB, you can define [Embeddings Generation Tasks](../../todo..) that generate embeddings from the content of your documents.
  These embeddings are stored in a dedicated collection within the database and enable vector search on your document content.

* Each embedding generation task must define a **connection string** to an embedding provider.  
  This connection string specifies where the embeddings will be generated,
  allowing RavenDB to integrate with external services such as Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google AI, Mistral AI, or RavenDB's embedded model (bge-micro-v2).

* While each task can have only one connection string, you can define multiple connection strings in your database to support different providers or configurations.  
  A single connection string can also be reused across multiple tasks in the database.

* These connection strings can be created from:
  * The **AI Connection Strings view** in the Studio, where you can create, edit, and delete connection strings that are not in use.
  * The **Client API** - examples are available in the dedicated articles for each provider.

![connection strings view](images/connection-strings-view.png "The AI Connection Strings view")

1. Go to the **AI Hub** menu.

2. Open the **AI Connection Strings** view.

3. Click **"Add new"** to create a new connection string.

4. View the list of all AI connection strings.

5. Edit or delete a connection string.  
   Only connection strings that are not in use by a task can be deleted.

{PANEL: Creating an AI connection string}

![create connection string](images/create-connection-string.png "Create connection string")

1. **Name**  
   Enter a name for the connection string.

2. **Identifier**  
   Enter an identifier for the connection string.  
   Allowed characters: only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-).  
   Learn more about the identifier in the following section: [The connection string identifier](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/connection-strings-overview#the-connection-string-identifier).

3. **Regenerate**  
   Click "Regenerate" to automatically create an identifier based on the connection string name.

4. **Connector**  
   Select an embedding generation provider from the dropdown menu.  
   This will open a popup where you can configure the connection details.  
   Configuration details for each provider are explained in the following articles:
   * [Azure Open AI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/azure-open-ai)
   * [Google AI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/google-ai)
   * [Hugging Face](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/hugging-face)
   * [Ollama](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/ollama)
   * [OpenAI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/open-ai)
   * [Mistral AI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/mistral-ai)
   * [Embedded model (bge-micro-v2)](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/embedded)

5. Once you complete all configurations for the selected provider in the popup view,  
   save the connection string definition.

**What is the connection string identifier?**  

* The connection string identifier is a unique identifier assigned to a connection string.  
  Each AI connection string in the database must have a distinct identifier.

* If not specified, or when clicking the "Regenerate" button,  
  RavenDB automatically generates the identifier based on the connection string name. For example:  
  * If the connection string name is: _"My connection string to Google AI"_
  * The generated identifier will be: _"my-connection-string-to-google-ai"_

* The identifier can only contain lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-).

**What is the identifier used for?**  

* The embeddings generated by the providers are stored as attachments in dedicated collections within your database.
  For example, embeddings generated from the content of documents in the `Products` collection will be stored in the `Products/Embeddings` collection.

* Additionally, each embedding received from the provider is cached in a special collection called `@embeddings-cache`.
  Each document in the `@embeddings-cache` collection contains a single attachment that has the embedding vector.
  => **The connection string identifier is part of this document ID**.

* This caching mechanism improves performance:  
  Before generating an embedding, RavenDB first checks the cache to determine if a vector from the requested provider is already available for the given text.
  If found in the embeddings cache, RavenDB uses that vector, avoiding unnecessary requests to the provider and reducing latency and API usage.  
  Learn more in the [@embedding-cache collection](../../todo..).
